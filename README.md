### Check out the [demo presentation](https://renerocksai.github.io/bullets/bullets.html)!

This software is so **fresh**, it's currently in usable alpha!

#### What is Bûllets? 

- Bûllets is a slide show software powered by the 
    **Godot game engine**

- It helps you create beautiful presentations on all 
    platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) that are 100% 
    self-contained  and will look and feel the same on all 
    platforms

- Using plain text with optional easy markup for 
    content makes slide creation a breeze

- If you know how to code, you can create the most 
    complex, interactive animations, with sound effects -
    or even embed a full game into your slides.

- You can share Bûllets presentations either as native 
    programs or publish them to the web
    - Like this [first demo](https://renerocksai.github.io/bullets/bullets.html)!

- PDF export is supported, too
    - Bûllets can create PNG images from your slides
    - a small browser tool converts the PNG slides to PDF
    - the conversion happens locally in the browser, no upload is required

- Bûllets presentations are version control friendly and 
    allow for GitHub collaboration

- And yes, it works with your favorite wireless clicker!
	- Even if that happens to be your  XBOX controller     
	- It **even comes with a laser pointer!**

	- You can **draw on slides**, too!

- It is a proof-of-concept and a work in progress

- It is also a hack
